# SQL COVID-19 Data Exploration

This project explores global COVID-19 data using SQL to analyze cases, deaths, vaccinations, and population-level trends.
The objective is to demonstrate practical SQL skills commonly used in data analyst roles, including joins, aggregations,
window functions, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs).

---

## Project Overview

The analysis focuses on understanding how COVID-19 impacted different countries by:
- Tracking total cases and deaths over time
- Calculating infection and death rates relative to population
- Analyzing vaccination progress across countries
- Identifying countries with the highest impact using population-adjusted metrics

This project mirrors real-world analytical workflows used in reporting and business intelligence environments.

## Datasets Used

- **COVID-19 Cases & Deaths**  
  Source: Our World in Data (via Kaggle)  
  Contains daily country-level data on cases, deaths, and population.

- **COVID-19 Vaccinations**  
  Source: Our World in Data (via Kaggle)  
  Includes vaccination counts and rollout progress by country.

---

## SQL Concepts Used

- Joins (INNER JOIN)
- Aggregate Functions (SUM, MAX, COUNT)
- Group By & Ordering
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window Functions (ROLLING SUM)
- Data Type Casting
- Calculated Fields & Metrics
- Filtering and Sorting

---

## Key Analysis Performed

- Total COVID-19 cases and deaths by country
- Death rate analysis (deaths vs total cases)
- Infection rate as a percentage of population
- Countries with highest cases and deaths per population
- Rolling total of vaccinations by country
- Vaccination progress compared to population size

---

## Example Metrics

- Death Percentage  
- Cases per Population  
- Deaths per Population  
- Rolling Vaccinations per Country  

These metrics help normalize the data and allow meaningful comparisons across countries of different population sizes.

---

## Outcome

The final result is a clean, analysis-ready SQL script that provides meaningful insights into global COVID-19 trends.
This project demonstrates the ability to:
- Work with large real-world datasets
- Write efficient and readable SQL queries
- Translate raw data into actionable insights

The output of this analysis can be easily connected to tools like **Power BI or Tableau** for visualization.

## How to Use

1. Import the datasets into your SQL environment
2. Run the SQL script step-by-step
3. Review the outputs for analysis and reporting
4. Use the results for dashboards or further exploration
